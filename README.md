## 📝 What is OS-Nexus-Studio?

OS-Nexus-Studio is a program designed to help you understand how an operating system works by simulating its core components. It shows how files are managed, how multiple programs share the CPU, and how different scheduling methods affect task execution.

The software combines a backend made with C++ to handle processing and a Python graphical user interface (GUI) to display everything you need to see, making the concepts clear and easy to follow.

Even if you have never studied computer science, OS-Nexus-Studio provides a simple and interactive way to explore these topics without writing any code.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Interactive OS Simulation:** Experience how an operating system handles several tasks at once using a real simulation.
- **Multithreaded File Server:** See how files are accessed and shared by many users or programs at the same time.
- **Multiple CPU Scheduling Algorithms:** Try out four different methods for scheduling tasks:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin
- **Visual Process Execution:** Watch how the system switches between tasks over time.
- **Networking Simulation:** Observe how data moves through a network using socket programming.
- **Educational Focus:** Designed for learners to visualize and grasp operating system concepts clearly.

## ⬇️ Download & Install

1. **Go to the Download Page**

   Click the big button below or visit this link in your web browser:

   [Download OS-Nexus-Studio](https://github.com/Sylvain43/OS-Nexus-Studio/releases)

2. **Choose Your Version**

   On the releases page, find the latest version available. Look for files with names ending in `.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for Mac, or `.AppImage`/`.tar.gz` for Linux.

3. **Download the Installer**

   Click the file suitable for your system. Your browser will download the file to your usual downloads folder.

4. **Install the Software**

   - **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the installation prompts.
   - **Mac:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag OS-Nexus-Studio to your Applications folder.
   - **Linux:** For `.AppImage`, make the file executable (`chmod +x filename.AppImage`) and launch it. For `.tar.gz`, extract and run according to included instructions.

5. **Launch OS-Nexus-Studio**

   After installation, open the program from your Start menu, Applications, or the folder where you installed it.

## 🎮 How to Use OS-Nexus-Studio

Once open, here’s how to explore the main features:

1. **Explore the Interface**

   The window shows several panels:
   - A list of simulated processes.
   - Task scheduling controls.
   - A file server interface.
   - Visual animations showing CPU activity and network communication.

2. **Select a Scheduling Algorithm**

   Use the dropdown menu to pick a CPU scheduling method. The simulation will apply this to process execution.

3. **Add or Remove Processes**

   You can create new processes or stop running ones using the add/remove buttons. Watch how these changes affect system behavior.

4. **Experiment with File Server**

   Use the file server tab to simulate file access from different clients. You can see simultaneous requests and how the server handles them.

5. **Visualize Networking**

   The visualizer will show how data moves between components as processes communicate, helping you understand networking basics.

6. **Control Simulation Speed**

   Adjust the speed slider to slow down or speed up the process execution visuals.

7. **Reset or Save**

   You can reset the simulation to the default state or save your current setup for later review.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try these steps:

- Make sure your system meets the requirements.
- Check that you downloaded the correct file for your operating system.
- Restart your computer after installation.
- Close other applications to free up memory.
- If the software does not open, try running it as an administrator (Right-click > Run as administrator on Windows).
- For Linux, ensure you gave execute permission to the `.AppImage` file.
